# what-are-we-gonna-eat-tonight

This is a project with an express server and a react front end (with webpack and babel),
that is tests with jest. The point is to use an API that provides several recipes.
When you have no idea what to cook for your family or when you just want some random ideas of what you should eat,
you just click a button and a random recipes comes out. Later, i would like to be able to add search by ingredients
(it is an option of the API) to make random finds more efficient depending on your mood or on what you wanna eat or maybe what you
have in the frigde you dont want to lose etc
