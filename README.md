# what-are-we-gonna-eat-tonight 

This is a project with an express server and a react front end (with webpack and babel),
that is tested with jest.

The point is to use an API that provides several recipes.
When you have no idea what to cook for your family or when you just want some random ideas of what you should eat,
you just click a button and some random recipes comes out.

You can also search recipes by ingredients to make random responses more efficient depending on your mood or on what
you wanna eat or maybe what you
have in the frigde you dont want to lose etc
